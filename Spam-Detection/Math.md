The `multiplication operator` denotes the product of two numbers or expressions. For example:

Code: python

```python
3 * 4 = 12
```

### Division (`/`)

The `division operator` denotes dividing one number or expression by another. For example:

Code: python

```python

```

## Algebraic Notations

### Subscript Notation (`x_t`)

The subscript notation represents a variable indexed by `t,` often indicating a specific time step or state in a sequence. For example:

Code: python

```python
x_t = q(x_t | x_{t-2})
```

This notation is commonly used in sequences and time series data, where each `x_t` represents the value of `x` at time `t`.

```

This notation is used in polynomial expressions and exponential functions.

### Norm (`||...||`)

The `norm` measures the size or length of a vector. The most common norm is the Euclidean norm, which is calculated as follows:

Code: python

```python
||v|| = sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + ... + v_n^2}
```

Other norms include the `L1 norm` (Manhattan distance) and the `L∞ norm` (maximum absolute value):

Code: python

```python
||v||_1 = |v_1| + |v_2| + ... + |v_n|
||v||_∞ = max(|v_1|, |v_2|, ..., |v_n|)
```

Norms are used in various applications, such as measuring the distance between vectors, regularizing models to prevent overfitting, and normalizing data.
